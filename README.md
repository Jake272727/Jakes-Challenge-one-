- Hello, I built this Project to clean up the code. I added Sematic elements to oragnise all the sections which makes it easier for the developer as the Html is more comprehensible. I also added Image alt tags after every image to imporve the SEO and Accessibility of the webiste. I learnt why sematic elements are so important to use.

## Installation
